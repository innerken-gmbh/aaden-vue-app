# Task 7: Documentation

## Description
This task involves updating documentation to reflect the new membership features.

## Subtasks
- Update code comments
- Update README or other documentation files
- Create user guide for the new features

## Implementation Process

### 1. Updating Code Comments
We need to update the code comments in all the files that were modified or created during the implementation of the membership features. This will involve adding JSDoc comments to functions, methods, and components to explain their purpose, parameters, and return values.

### 2. Updating README or Other Documentation Files
We need to update the README or other documentation files to include information about the new membership features. This will involve adding sections about the membership features, how to use them, and any configuration that may be required.

### 3. Creating User Guide
We need to create a user guide for the new membership features. This will involve creating a document that explains how to use the membership features from a user's perspective.

## Implementation Details

### Code Comments
We need to add JSDoc comments to the following files:
- src/views/TablePage/TablePage.vue
- src/views/TablePage/Dialog/MemberSelectionDialog.vue
- src/views/TablePage/Dialog/MemberDetailDialog.vue
- src/api/Repository/OrderInfo.js
- src/api/MemberCloud/MemberCloudApi.js (or updated VIPCloudApi.js)

Example JSDoc comment for a function:
```
/**
 * Sets the order auto claim customer ID.
 * 
 * @param {string} orderId - The ID of the order.
 * @param {string} customerId - The ID of the customer.
 * @returns {Promise<any>} The response content.
 * @throws {Error} If there is an error setting the order auto claim customer ID.
 */
export async function setOrderAutoClaimCustomerId(orderId, customerId) {
  // Function implementation
}
```

### README Update
We need to add a section to the README about the membership features:

```
## Membership Features

The Aaden Desktop application now includes membership features that allow you to:
- Display member login status
- Select members via UI or NFC scanning
- View detailed member information
- Track member orders
- Claim awards for members

### Configuration

To use the membership features, you need to configure the following:
- Cloud API endpoint: Set the `CLOUD_API_ENDPOINT` environment variable to the URL of the cloud API (default: cloud-v2.aaden.io).
- Device ID: Set the `DEVICE_ID` environment variable to the ID of your device.

### Usage

To use the membership features:
1. Open a table page
2. Click the member selection button in the header
3. Select a member from the list or scan an NFC card
4. View the member's details and orders
5. Perform actions such as adding points or claiming awards
```

### User Guide
We need to create a user guide for the membership features. This will be a separate document that explains how to use the membership features from a user's perspective.
