# Task 3: Create Member Detail Dialog

## Description
This task involves creating a new dialog to display detailed member information.

## Subtasks
- Create new MemberDetailDialog.vue component
- Display member information (name, ID, balance, points, etc.) using `/membership/user/getUserBusinessLayerDetails/{userId}/{blId}` endpoint
- Add actions for member management (edit, add points, claim awards, etc.)
- Implement award claiming using `/membership/award/claim/{userId}/{awardProgressId}` endpoint
- Display user orders using `/cloudOrders/user-orders/{userId}` endpoint
- Implement proper navigation between selection and detail dialogs

## Implementation Process

### 1. Component Structure Planning
We need to create a new MemberDetailDialog.vue component that will display detailed member information. This component will be similar to the MemberSelectionDialog.vue but will focus on displaying detailed information about a single member.

### 2. Creating the Component
We will create the MemberDetailDialog.vue component with the following structure:
- Dialog container
- Member information section (name, ID, balance, points, etc.)
- Actions section (edit, add points, claim awards, etc.)
- Orders section (list of user orders)

### 3. Implementing API Integration
We need to implement API integration to fetch member details and orders:
- Use `/membership/user/getUserBusinessLayerDetails/{userId}/{blId}` endpoint to get member details
- Use `/membership/award/claim/{userId}/{awardProgressId}` endpoint to claim awards
- Use `/cloudOrders/user-orders/{userId}` endpoint to get user orders

### 4. Adding User Interface Elements
We need to add UI elements to display member information and provide actions:
- Display member name, ID, balance, points, etc.
- Add buttons for actions like edit, add points, claim awards, etc.
- Display a list of user orders

### 5. Implementing Navigation
We need to implement proper navigation between the selection and detail dialogs:
- Add a back button to return to the selection dialog
- Add a confirm button to select the member and close the dialog

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure
```vue
<template>
  <v-dialog v-model="show" max-width="600">
    <v-card>
      <!-- Member information section -->
      <!-- Actions section -->
      <!-- Orders section -->
      <!-- Navigation buttons -->
    </v-card>
  </v-dialog>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'MemberDetailDialog',
  props: {
    value: Boolean,
    memberId: String,
    businessLayerId: String
  },
  data() {
    return {
      show: false,
      memberDetails: null,
      orders: [],
      loading: false,
      error: null
    }
  },
  methods: {
    // API integration methods
    // Navigation methods
  }
}
</script>
```

### API Integration
1. Use the `getUserBusinessLayerDetails` function from Task 1 to get member details
2. Use the `claimAward` function from Task 1 to claim awards
3. Use the `getUserOrders` function from Task 1 to get user orders

Example code:
```javascript
// Import the functions from Task 1
import { 
  getUserBusinessLayerDetails, 
  claimAward, 
  getUserOrders 
} from '../api/MemberCloud/MemberCloudApi'

// In the component
export default {
  // ... other component options
  methods: {
    async loadMemberDetails() {
      try {
        this.loading = true
        this.memberDetails = await getUserBusinessLayerDetails(this.memberId, this.businessLayerId)
        this.orders = await getUserOrders(this.memberId)
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error loading member details:', error)
        this.error = 'Failed to load member details'
      } finally {
        this.loading = false
      }
    },

    async claimMemberAward(awardProgressId) {
      try {
        this.loading = true
        await claimAward(this.memberId, awardProgressId)
        // Reload member details to reflect changes
        await this.loadMemberDetails()
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error claiming award:', error)
        this.error = 'Failed to claim award'
      } finally {
        this.loading = false
      }
    }
  }
}
```
